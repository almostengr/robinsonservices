## Common Questions About Sense Energy Montior

### How does it work?

The way that Sense works, is that it monitors your home's electrical usage. From there, it learns the 
unique signature that each device has to determine when it is running. From this analysis
Sense can estimate how much your monthly electrical bill will be, send you alerts if a 
device is running longer than normal, let you know when a device turns on or off, and 
show much power each device is using.

### Customer Changes After Sense Installation

The customer had a number of ceiling fans that had incandescent bulbs with candelabra base. Each time a 
light was turned on, Sense reported that each light was pulling between 100 and 150 watts. The real time
energy usage that Sense provided, help persuade the customer to switch to more efficient lighting and 
power saving methods around the home.

After having Sense installed, this customer switched from a mix of incandescent and CFL
(Compact Florescent Lights) to CFL and mostly LED bulbs to reduce their monthly 
electrical bill.
By switching from incandescent to LED, when the same lights are turned on, they draw
between 5 and 15 watts. A 90 to 95 percent decrease in lighting energy usage.
