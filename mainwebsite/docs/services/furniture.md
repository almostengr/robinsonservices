## Common Furniture Assembly Questions

### Is it that hard to put furniture together?

No it is not. However, depending on the item, there are a lot of small parts and the instructions can be
confusing. Many times, furniture that is not already assembled comes with instructions,
but the instructions do not have words. Thus many people struggle with putting
furniture together because they are unable to understand the drawings.

### What furniture do you assemble?

RHT Services has put together a number of furniture pieces. This includes beds, baby cribs,
patio furniture, pool tables, recliners, television (TV) stands, and dining room tables. If it needs to be
put together, then we can do it.

### I have furniture to be assembled, but I have lost the instructions? Can you still do it?

It is possible that we can still put the furniture together without the instructions, but it may take more 
time to complete the task. 

### Furniture I ordered is damaged. What do I do?

We check the parts before assembling the furniture to make sure that everything is good working order. We have 
discovered that sometimes furniture is damaged during delivery. When we find damaged furniture pieces, we 
inform the customer of this and allow them to decide whether to continue with the assembly or to contact 
the vendor to have a replacement sent or refund given.
