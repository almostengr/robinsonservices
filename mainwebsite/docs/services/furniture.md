## Common Furniture Assembly Questions

### Is it that hard to put furniture together?

No it is not. However, depending on the item, there are a lot of small parts and the instructions can be
confusing. Many times, furniture that is not already assembled comes with instructions,
but the instructions do not have words. Thus many people struggle with putting
furniture together because they are unable to understand the drawings.

### What furniture do you assemble?

RHT Services has put together a number of furniture pieces. This includes beds, baby cribs,
patio furniture, pool tables, recliners, television (TV) stands, and dining room tables. If it needs to be
put together, then we can do it.
