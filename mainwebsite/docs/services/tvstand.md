## Common Questions About TV Stands

### Are all TV stands the same?

No they are not. The width of the TV stand determines how large of a TV that it can hold. If the TV is 
bigger than the TV stand, then it will not work.

There are some exceptions to this. If the TV has a single base in the middle of the TV instead of legs 
near the ends of the TV, then it is possible to place a larger TV on the stand than 
the stand itself. However, this is not advised.
