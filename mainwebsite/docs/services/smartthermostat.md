description: Thermostat being replaced for a customer.

This project, an old thermostat was removed and replaced with an Ecobee 3 Lite Thermostat. As part of the 
installation, I shared with the customer some of the features that she was not aware that the thermostat
has including Circulation Mode. Also assisted with getting the thermostat connected to the customer's 
WiFi network.

## Common Thermostat Replacement Questions

### Are all thermostats the same? 

They are not. Traditional programmable thermostats run off of batteries. Smart thermostats run off of power
supplied by your air conditioner unit.

### Can I have a smart thermostat but not connect it to the internet?

Yes you can. Do note, that because it is not connected to the internet, that many of the features, such as 
being able to change the temperature while away from home, energy savings based on the weather conditions, 
and software updates will not be available.
