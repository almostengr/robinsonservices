description: Thermostat being replaced for a customer.

This project, an old thermostat was removed and replaced with an Ecobee 3 Lite Thermostat. As part of the 
installation, I shared with the customer some of the features that she was not aware that the thermostat
has including Circulation Mode. Also assisted with getting the thermostat connected to the customer's 
WiFi network.
