no longer works, RHT Services replaces light fixtures.

## Common Light Fixture Questions

### Is there a certain light fixture I need to get?

There is not. Light fixture wiring and mounting points are all the same. Just pick one that that
fits your preferences and style and RHT Services will install it.

### I want brighter bulbs in my fixture, but it says that only low wattage blubs can be used. Why is this?

In 2005, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Part of this legislation limits the amount of power
that a ceiling fan and other multi-bulb fixtures can consume. As a result of this legislation,
some manufacturers updated their products to have a wattage limiter switch.
Other manufacturers took things a step further and designed
their fixtures to use candelabra bulbs instead of standard Edison bulbs. The candelabra bulbs
have a smaller base and usually consume less power than the common Edison bulbs.

Thus if you try to use bulbs that consume more power than what the fixture is rated for, either the light
will not work or the light may catch fire due to it pulling more power than it is rated for.
