Did you know that the more devices that you have on a computer network, the more likely that network is 
to have slower speeds. Network traffic functions similar to traffic on the road. When there are more 
cars on the road, the greater the congestion and longer the travel time. Most homes have a least 5 devices
connected to their network. This includes computers, tablets, smart phones, and streaming devices. 
Not having your network optimized for the best performance, results in internet streams buffering and 
videos playing in lower quality by default.

RHT Services provides home networking services. By properly dividing your home network up, you will see
improved speeds and almost no buffering with your streaming devices.

## Common Home Networking Questions

### Wireless (WiFi) is better than wired (Ethernet) correct?

False. While wireless is more convenient, is has always been slower than the latest wired standard.

With wireless networks, only one device can send or receive data a time. This would be the equivalent 
of a cars navigating a single lane road. Traffic can only move in one direction at a time. 
With wired or Ethernet networks, all devices can send and receive data at the same time. This would be 
the equivalent of cars driving on the interstate or other multi-lane highway.

In addition, wireless signals can interfere with each other, thus further slowing the overall speed
of the network. The impact of this is more common with 
those that live in apartments or other multi-unit dwellings that are close together
than in single family houses. While this 
can be resolved, it does take technical knowledge and know how to address it. RHT Services has 
this knowledge from years of experience working with technology. 

### I don’t want to run wires through my house to get the fastest internet speeds. 

You don’t have to. Part of the Home Networking service is to run wire through the attic or basement 
to connect your entire home. Just [book an appointment](https://rhtservices.square.site/) to get started.
