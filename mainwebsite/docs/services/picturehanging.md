## Common Picture Hanging Questions

### Can I hang a picture anywhere I want to?

Short answer is no. Hanging a picture anywhere, could result in that picture falling off of the wall and 
harming someone.

Some pictures are light enough that they can be hung anywhere without being driven into a stud. However, 
it is always best to hang a picture with the appropriate fastener nailed into a stud or wall framing.

### Do I really need a picture hanging hooks or can I use a nail? 

Proper way to hang picture is to use a picture hanging hook. Picture hanging hooks are designed in a way 
that they hold the picture up against gravity. Using a nail or screw will work, 
but requires that the fastener be installed in a particular way so that it does not fall out of the 
wall or fall from the weight of the picture being on it.
