purchased and provided the TV mount to be installed. The mount provided was a swivel mount that allows
the TV to be positioned in multiple angles. The television was a 42 inch.

## Common TV Mounting Questions

### Can I buy any mount for my TV?

No. The mount that is needed for a TV is determined by the size and weight of TV to 
be mounted.

Some manufacturers, like 
LG and Samsung, have specially designed mounts for their TVs. Thus you MUST buy that manufacturer's mount 
for the TV and not a generic name brand mount. Check the TV documentation or the 
manufacturerâ€™s website to see if that TV requires a specific mount.

### Can I mount a TV over the fireplace?

The common answer from manufacturers is no. The reason being is that 
heat rises and as a result, the heat from the 
fireplace will go upward where the TV is. This can result in the TV overheating and thus
malfunction or stop working.

What we advise is that if customers do not use their fireplace, then TV over the fireplace 
is fine. However, if customers do use their fireplace, then we would suggest that the TV
be mounted elsewhere to prevent the TV from being damaged or destroyed.

### What is the difference between Swivel Mount and Flush Mount?

Swivel mounts allow the TV to be moved and positioned at different angles. These are 
commonly preferred when the TV is mounted in a open concept space as the TV can be 
pointed where the viewer can always see it.

Flush mounts are stationary and cannot be moved. These are used in bedrooms and
spaces that are not open concept as the viewer is usually always within sight of the TV.

### Why is there an extra charge to run wires in the wall?

Reason that TV mounters charge more to run the wires in the wall is because some walls have 
obstacles that the wires have to be run around or through, such as fire 
blocks, other wires, insulation, and pipes. Using the wrong tool or making the wrong move, can cause 
additional problems that have to be addressed. 

Concrete and tiled walls require special tools in order to drill through them. Using the wrong tool on 
these types of walls, can result in damage that would result in repair work needing to be done.
