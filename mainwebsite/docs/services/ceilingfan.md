One of the essentials for living is the south is to have ceiling fans. Ceiling fans provide air circulation and increased indoor comfort. When you have one installed, the room feels cooler without having to turn down the thermostat.

Ceiling fans are not designed to last forever. Most common reasons for ceiling fans to
stop working is because the motor has gone bad. The motor has many components that
make it up. When any of those being to malfunction or stop working, then the fan stops
working.

## Common Ceiling Fan Questions

### What size fan do I need?

There are a number of options available when it comes to replacing ceiling fans. The
most important of these options is the size of the fan. The size
of ceiling fan is determined by the size of the room that the fan will be installed in.
Too small of a fan, will result in the lack of air circulation.

### Do I really need a down rod?

It depends on the height of the ceiling. Ideally, ceiling fans are close enough to the floor where the
occupants of the room can feel the breeze from the fan, but high enough so that the occupants do not hit
their heads (or any other body part) on the fan when walking under it. The general rule is that if you have
a ceiling height greater than 8 feet, then you do need a down rod. The length of the down rod is determined
by the height of the ceiling.

Flush mount ceiling fans are not designed for a down rod, and thus should only be used on ceilings that
are lower than 9 feet.

### Is it cheaper to replace the motor than to buy a new fan?

No it isnâ€™t. Fans are very complex and have many designs. Flush mount ceiling fans
are made differently than down rod ceiling fans. As a result, their motors are made to fit
in the housing. Unlike car parts, finding that exact replacement motor for your ceiling
fan is not as easy as you think. It is best to replace the existing fan with a new one instead
of trying to find replacement parts.
