Air filters keep your home free of dust and your HVAC equipment protected. Like the filters on a car,
your homeâ€™s air filter needs to be changed regularly. Failing to change the filter regularly can result

## Common Air Filter Questions

### How often do I need to change the air filter?

Air filters have their maximum usage listed on the filter or the filter's packaging. It is best recommended
to follow this information.
As a general rule, filter should be changed at least once per quarter or every 90 days. Some filters are
designed to be changed monthly.

### Does filter size matter?

Yes it does. While HVAC systems operate in a similar manner, they are not all the same size. Thus you need 
to purchase a filter that is the appropriate size for your system. Too big of a filter, will not fit in the 
filter housing. Too small of a filter means the filter can fall out of the housing and that all 
of the air that goes into your HVAC system does not get cleaned. Dirty air going into your HVAC system
can cause a number of problems including premature system failure.

### My filters are always black when I change them. Is this a concern?

Not really. It does mean that the filter is collecting the dust and dirt from being recirculated back into 
your home.
One recommendation for dark filters is to change them more often. A really dirty filter can cause problems 
with your HVAC system including but not limited to freezing coils, longer run times, and 
premature system failure.
