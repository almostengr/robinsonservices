## Common Air Filter Questions

### How often do I need to change the air filter?

Air filters have their maximum usage listed on the filter or the filter's packaging. It is best recommended
to follow this information.
As a general rule, filter should be changed at least once per quarter or every 90 days. Some filters are
designed to be changed monthly.

### Does filter size matter?

Yes it does. While HVAC systems operate in a similar manner, they are not all the same size. Thus you need
to purchase a filter that is the appropriate size for your system. Too big of a filter, will not fit in the
filter housing. Too small of a filter means the filter can fall out of the housing and that all
of the air that goes into your HVAC system does not get cleaned. Dirty air going into your HVAC system
can cause a number of problems including premature system failure.

### My filters are always black when I change them. Is this a concern?

Not really. It does mean that the filter is collecting the dust and dirt from being recirculated back into
your home.
One recommendation for dark filters is to change them more often. A really dirty filter can cause problems
with your HVAC system including but not limited to freezing coils, longer run times, and
premature system failure.

### I don't remember when I last changed my filter. How do you recommend I keep track of it?

#### The Thermostat Will Tell You

Some thermostats will track the number of days or how long the system has ran between filter changes. Then when a set
amount of time has passed, it will display a notification alerting you that the filter needs to be changed.
Once the filter has been changed, then alert on your thermostat will need to be reset.

#### Write It On The Filter

If your thermostat does not track the amount of time between filters, then you can
write the date of when you installed the filter on the filter. Then when you look at the filter
in the future, you know when the last time that it was changed.

#### Phone or Calendar Reminder

Put a reminder in your phone or calendar for when the next filter change needs to be done. Then
when that date arrives, change the filter and create a new reminder for the next filter change.

### I have to get the thickest filter for the cleanest air right?

No. HVAC professionals will tell you that thick filters actually restrict air flow, thus causing some of 
the same problems that a clogged or dirty air filter would cause. It is best to have a thinner filter, that 
actually allows the system to breathe than a thick filter that could starve the system for air.

Using a thinner filter and changing it at a regular interval will result in the best air possible and 
keep your system working smoothly.
