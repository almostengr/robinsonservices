title: Air Filter Replacement Service
---

Air filters keep your home free of dust and your HVAC equipment protected. Like the filters on a car, 
your homeâ€™s air filter needs to be changed regularly. Failing to change the filter regularly can result 
in your HVAC equipment having issues, such as freezing coils, poor air flow, and longer run times. 
RHT Services changes air filters, including those that are hard to reach filters that are located 
on the ceiling. [Schedule](/request) your filter change appointment today!
