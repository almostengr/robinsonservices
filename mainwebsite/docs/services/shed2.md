description: Assembly of a shed by RHT Services LLC

A customer had this shed for some time. Someone had committed to assemblying it, but had not done so.
Because a significant amount of time had passed between when it was purchased and when the
assembly had taken, several of the items,
including the instructions were misplaced. Thus this shed was assembled based on how it should appear.
