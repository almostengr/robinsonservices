## Common Door Knob Replacements

### If I replace the door knob, do I have to get a new set of keys?

No you don't. Certain manufacturers make locks that can be rekeyed without having to call a locksmith. These 
locks have a special tool that requires both the old key and new key to be used when rekeying the lock.

### This lock costs way more than that lock. A lock is just a lock right?

This is incorrect. There are 3 major grades of door locks that you can purchase. To properly secure your home,
you would want to have a ANSI Grade 1. If a Grade 1 lock is out of your budget, a Grade 2 would be the next 
best option. By all means, avoid Grade 3 locks, which are usually the cheapest and may not be built for 
the greatest protection.
