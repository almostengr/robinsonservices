Like the filters on a car, your home\u2019s air filter needs to be changed regularly. Failing to change the filter regularly can result in your HVAC equipment having issues, such as freezing coils, poor air flow, and longer run times. RHT Services changes air filters, including those that are hard to reach filters that are located on the ceiling. Schedule your filter change appointment today! Common Air Filter Questions How often do I need to change the air filter? Air filters have their maximum usage listed on the filter or the filter's packaging. It is best recommended to follow this information. As a general rule, filter should be changed at least once per quarter or every 90 days. Some filters are designed to be changed monthly. Does filter size matter? Yes it does. While HVAC systems operate in a similar manner, they are not all the same size. Thus you need to purchase a filter that is the appropriate size for your system. Too big of a filter, will not fit in the filter housing. Too small of a filter means the filter can fall out of the housing and that all of the air that goes into your HVAC system does not get cleaned. Dirty air going into your HVAC system can cause a number of problems including premature system failure. My filters are always black when I change them. Is this a concern? Not really. It does mean that the filter is collecting the dust and dirt from being recirculated back into your home. One recommendation for dark filters is to change them more often. A really dirty filter can cause problems with your HVAC system including but not limited to freezing coils, longer run times, and premature system failure. Ready to get started?

Ceiling fans provide air circulation and increased indoor comfort. When you have one installed, the room feels cooler without having to turn down the thermostat. Ceiling fans are not designed to last forever. Most common reasons for ceiling fans to stop working is because the motor has gone bad. The motor has many components that make it up. When any of those being to malfunction or stop working, then the fan stops working. Common Ceiling Fan Questions What size fan do I need? There are a number of options available when it comes to replacing ceiling fans. The most important of these options is the size of the fan. The size of ceiling fan is determined by the size of the room that the fan will be installed in. Too small of a fan, will result in the lack of air circulation. Do I really need a down rod? It depends on the height of the ceiling. Ideally, ceiling fans are close enough to the floor where the occupants of the room can feel the breeze from the fan, but high enough so that the occupants do not hit their heads (or any other body part) on the fan when walking under it. The general rule is that if you have a ceiling height greater than 8 feet, then you do need a down rod. The length of the down rod is determined by the height of the ceiling. Flush mount ceiling fans are not designed for a down rod, and thus should only be used on ceilings that are lower than 9 feet. Is it cheaper to replace the motor than to buy a new fan? No it isn\u2019t. Fans are very complex and have many designs. Flush mount ceiling fans are made differently than down rod ceiling fans. As a result, their motors are made to fit in the housing. Unlike car parts, finding that exact replacement motor for your ceiling fan is not as easy as you think. It is best to replace the existing fan with a new one instead of trying to find replacement parts. Ready to get started?

Network traffic functions similar to traffic on the road. When there are more cars on the road, the greater the congestion and longer the travel time. Most homes have a least 5 devices connected to their network. This includes computers, tablets, smart phones, and streaming devices. Not having your network optimized for the best performance, results in internet streams buffering and videos playing in lower quality by default. RHT Services provides home networking services. By properly dividing your home network up, you will see improved speeds and almost no buffering with your streaming devices. Schedule your home networking service appointment today! Common Home Networking Questions Wireless (WiFi) is better than wired (Ethernet) correct? False. While wireless is more convenient, is usually slower than the latest wired standard. With wireless, only one device can send or receive data a time. This would be the equivalent of a cars going through a single lane road construction zone. Only traffic in one direction move at a time. With wired or Ethernet, all devices can send and receive data at the same time. This would be the equivalent of cars driving on the interstate or other multi-lane highway. In addition, wireless signals can interfere with each other, thus further slowing the overall speed of the network. The impact of this is more common with those that live in apartments or other multi-unit dwellings than in single family houses. While this can be resolved, it does take technical knowledge and know how to address it. RHT Services has this knowledge from years of experience working with technology.

Network traffic functions similar to traffic on the road. When there are more cars on the road, the greater the congestion and longer the travel time. Most homes have a least 5 devices connected to their network. This includes computers, tablets, smart phones, and streaming devices. Not having your network optimized for the best performance, results in internet streams buffering and videos playing in lower quality by default. RHT Services provides home networking services. By properly dividing your home network up, you will see improved speeds and almost no buffering with your streaming devices.

While wireless is more convenient, is usually slower than the latest wired standard. With wireless, only one device can send or receive data a time. This would be the equivalent of a cars going through a single lane road construction zone. Only traffic in one direction move at a time. With wired or Ethernet, all devices can send and receive data at the same time. This would be the equivalent of cars driving on the interstate or other multi-lane highway. In addition, wireless signals can interfere with each other, thus further slowing the overall speed of the network. The impact of this is more common with those that live in apartments or other multi-unit dwellings than in single family houses. While this can be resolved, it does take technical knowledge and know how to address it. RHT Services has this knowledge from years of experience working with technology.","title":"Wireless (WiFi) is better than wired (Ethernet) correct?"},{"location":"services/homenetwork/#i-dont-want-to-run-wires-through-my-house-to-get-the-fastest-internet-speeds","text":"You don\u2019t have to.

Just pick one that that fits your preferences and style and RHT Services will install it. I want brighter bulbs in my fixture, but it says that only low wattage blubs can be used. Why is this? In 2005, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Part of this legislation limits the amount of power that a ceiling fan and other multi-bulb fixtures can consume. As a result of this legislation, some manufacturers updated their products to have a wattage limiter switch. Other manufacturers took things a step further and designed their fixtures to use candelabra bulbs instead of standard Edison bulbs. The candelabra bulbs have a smaller base and usually consume less power than the common Edison bulbs. Thus if you try to use bulbs that consume more power than what the fixture is rated for, either the light will not work or the light may catch fire due to it pulling more power than it is rated for.

Hanging a picture anywhere, could result in that picture falling off of the wall and harming someone. Some pictures are light enough that they can be hung anywhere without being driven into a stud. However, it is always best to hang a picture with the appropriate fastener nailed into a stud or wall framing. Do I really need a picture hanging hooks or can I use a nail?

The Sense Energy Monitor tracks the energy usage in a home. Common Questions About Sense Energy Montior How does it work? The way that Sense works, is that it monitors your home's electrical usage. From there, it learns the unique signature that each device has to determine when it is running. From this analysis Sense can estimate how much your monthly electrical bill will be, send you alerts if a device is running longer than normal, let you know when a device turns on or off, and show much power each device is using. Customer Changes After Sense Installation The customer had a number of ceiling fans that had incandescent bulbs with candelabra base. Each time a light was turned on, Sense reported that each light was pulling between 100 and 150 watts. The real time energy usage that Sense provided, help persuade the customer to switch to more efficient lighting and power saving methods around the home. After having Sense installed, this customer switched from a mix of incandescent and CFL (Compact Florescent Lights) to CFL and mostly LED bulbs to reduce their monthly electrical bill. By switching from incandescent to LED, when the same lights are turned on, they draw between 5 and 15 watts. A 90 to 95 percent decrease in lighting energy usage. Ready to get started?

Customer stated that he was going to use the shed to store chemicals for his pool. This shed was designed to hide garbage cans. Common Shed Questions Can a shed be placed it directly on the ground? This depends. Some sheds are not designed to be placed directly on the ground. These type of sheds require that you purchase an additional floor kit. The purpose of the floor kit is to keep the bottom of the shed from separating. In addition to the above, the ground that the shed is being placed on must be level. If the ground is not level, then you can experience problems with your shed, such as the doors such as the doors not opening properly and water getting inside the shed. Do large sheds require permits? This varies by city and county. In the City of Montgomery, sheds larger than 200 square feet (sq ft) do require that a permit is acquired before it is built. Sheds that are already built and are only being moved to an owners property do not have to get a permit for their shed regardless of their size. We recommend checking with your local city or county government regarding permits for sheds. Do sheds have to be anchored to the ground? Yes they do. Sheds that are not anchored to the ground are more likely to blow away during severe weather or storms. Even if the shed has heavy items in them, the shed could still blow away or fall over if not properly anchored. RHT Services will will install anchors for sheds if requested. Ready to get started?

The customer purchased and provided the TV mount to be installed. The mount provided was a swivel mount that allows the TV to be positioned in multiple angles. The television was a 42 inch. Common TV Mounting Questions Can I buy any mount for my TV? No. The mount that is needed for a TV is determined by the size and weight of TV to be mounted. A mount designed for a 40 inch TV may not necessarily work for a 65 inch TV. Some manufacturers, like LG and Samsung, have certain TV models that require a manufacturer specific mount. Thus you MUST buy that manufacturer's mount for the TV and not a generic name brand mount. Check your TV owners manual or the manufacturer\u2019s website to see your TV model requires a specific mount. Can I mount a TV over the fireplace? The common answer from manufacturers is no. The reason being is that heat rises and as a result, the heat from the fireplace will go upward where the TV is. This can result in the TV overheating and thus malfunction or stop working. What we advise is that if customers do not use their fireplace, then TV over the fireplace is fine. However, if customers do use their fireplace, then we would suggest that the TV be mounted elsewhere to prevent the TV from being damaged or destroyed. What is the difference between Swivel Mount and Flush Mount? Swivel mounts allow the TV to be moved and positioned at different angles. These are commonly preferred when the TV is mounted in a open concept space as the TV can be pointed where the viewer can always see it. Flush mounts are stationary and cannot be moved. These are used in bedrooms and spaces that are not open concept as the viewer is usually always within sight of the TV. Why is there an extra charge to run wires in the wall? Reason that TV mounters charge more to run the wires in the wall is because some walls have obstacles that the wires have to be run around or through, such as fire blocks, other wires, insulation, and pipes. Using the wrong tool or making the wrong move, can cause additional problems that have to be addressed. Concrete and tiled walls require special tools in order to drill through them. Using the wrong tool on these types of walls, can result in damage that would result in repair work needing to be done. Ready to get started?
